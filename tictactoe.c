/*
    Plan: Write a program that plays tic tac toc.
    Game is played on a 3x3 grid, played by two players (take turns).
    You should create an array to represent the board.
    Can be of type char and consist of 10 elements (do not use zero).
    Each element represents a co-ordinate on the board that the user can select.
    Some functions that you can probably create:
    checkForWin - checks to see if a player has won or the game is a draw.
    drawboard - redraws the board for each player turn.
    markBoard - sets the char array with a selection 
    and check for an invalid selection.
